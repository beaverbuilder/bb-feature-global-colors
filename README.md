## Global Colours
Feature test plugin to test field connections in Beaver Builder Core which adds ability to use global colours..

# Please Note
This plugin is **NOT** compatible yet with Themer as of 1.4.1.2, a later release will add a patch so the two work together.
If you have Themer active please disable it until a Themer compatibilty atch is released.

All support for this feature test plugin is handled here, or on the Slack via myself (Simon), please dont ask for support via the helpdesk.

## How to use
Download the zip and install and activate like a normal WP plugin https://github.com/beaverbuilder/bb-feature-global-colors/releases

You will now find a new Colours tab under the builder Global Options where you can set five Global Colours.

Any Module setting that can use a colour you will notice the normal Themer _plus_ icon, if you click it you will be able to select one of the five Global Colours.

Updating the Global Colours in the Global Options will change all instances where you have added the colour connection!
